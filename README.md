## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Incorporate cookies and sessions into web apps for persistent user experiences.
* Set up Firebase systems to store remote data.
* Build apps that collect user input and save them to the cloud using AJAX in tandem with Firebaseâ€™s API.

## Homework

* **Train Time** (Recommended)
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
